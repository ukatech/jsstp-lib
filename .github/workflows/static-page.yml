# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy static content to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["master"]
    # and only run when the following files are changed
    paths:
      - "dist/**"
      - "docs/**"
      - ".github/pages/**"
      - "README.md"
      # 省略掉src目录，因为src目录下的文件会触发build，进而更新dist目录
